The Training Dataset.arff and Testing Dataset.arff files are used to train and test the machine learning model in the Phishing Link Detector project. These files contain a collection of labeled data, where each instance represents a web page and its corresponding label (either "legitimate" or "phishing").

To create these files, you would need to collect a large dataset of web pages, label them as either legitimate or phishing, and then format the data into the ARFF (Attribute-Relation File Format) format.

Here's a step-by-step guide to creating the Training Dataset.arff and Testing Dataset.arff files:

Step 1: Collect Web Pages

Collect a large dataset of web pages, including both legitimate and phishing websites. You can use web scraping techniques or collect data from existing datasets.

Step 2: Label the Data

Label each web page as either "legitimate" or "phishing". You can use a combination of manual labeling and automated tools to label the data.

Step 3: Extract Features

Extract relevant features from each web page, such as:

URL length
Presence of HTTPS
Presence of suspicious keywords
Number of external links
Number of images
etc.
Step 4: Format the Data

Format the data into the ARFF format, which consists of:

A header section that describes the attributes (features) and their data types
A data section that contains the instances (web pages) and their corresponding attribute values
Here's an example of what the ARFF file might look like:

@relation phishing_dataset

@attribute url_length {numeric}
@attribute https {numeric}
@attribute suspicious_keywords {numeric}
@attribute external_links {numeric}
@attribute images {numeric}
@attribute label {nominal, legitimate, phishing}

@data
url_length,https,suspicious_keywords,external_links,images,label
54,1,0,5,10,legitimate
75,0,1,10,5,phishing
...


Step 5: Split the Data

Split the data into two files: Training Dataset.arff and Testing Dataset.arff. The training dataset should contain a large majority of the data (e.g. 80-90%), and the testing dataset should contain the remaining data.

You can use a random split or a stratified split to ensure that the testing dataset has a similar distribution of labels as the training dataset.

Step 6: Use the Data

Use the Training Dataset.arff file to train the machine learning model, and use the Testing Dataset.arff file to evaluate the model's performance.
